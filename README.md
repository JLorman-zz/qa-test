# Talent Source QA Test

## Instructions
#### Setup
Clone this repository and run `yarn install`. Familiarize yourself with the cypress testing suite by going to cypress.io
or by looking at the `cypress/integration/examples-cypress-default` tests. Once you are familiar, contact who sent you
this test to schedule the time to take the test. You will be given 1 hour 30 minutes to complete the test.

#### Test
You will be given the two questions to complete for the test, provided to you at the start of the test. 
You will  Create a new branch off of the `master` branch with your name in the branch name.
Complete both questions within the test associated test files in `cypress/integration/exam-tests`.
If you have any questions, you may contact who is providing this test during your test time.

When the test time ends, or you complete your code (which ever comes first), add and commit the test files to your branch.
Push your branch up to this repository.
